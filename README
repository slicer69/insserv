README for insserv

insserv is a boot sequence organizer using LSB init.d script dependency 
information. It is typically used alongside the SysV init software.


Compiling

insserv can be built with most modern compilers, including GCC and Clang.
One of the software's few dependencies is the D-bus devlopment libraries. The
D-bus packages are called libdbus-dev under Debian/Ubuntu. For example,
libdbus-1-dev on Debian.


Installing

To build insserv, run the command "make install" in the top level of the
source directory. To install the innserv software, run "sudo make install".
This will perform some checks and then copy the software into place.
